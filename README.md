# Audio Voice Separation

> *"Clean audio is the cornerstone of creativity and intelligent systems. Isolate vocals, extract instrumentals, and build pristine audio datasets."*

Welcome to **Audio Voice Separation**—a versatile tool that harnesses the power of the [Demucs](https://github.com/facebookresearch/demucs) model alongside robust Python libraries such as `pydub` and `torch` to effortlessly split your audio files into vocals and instrumental tracks. This tool is designed not only for creative projects like remixing and karaoke but also for professional applications such as podcast editing, forensic analysis, and AI data cleaning for multimodal systems.

## Overview

Audio Voice Separation transforms your audio processing workflow by breaking down complex tracks into clear, isolated components. Whether you're a music producer, sound engineer, AI researcher, or forensic analyst, this tool delivers high-quality separated audio that enhances both creative expression and technical performance. Enjoy clean vocals for accurate transcriptions, crisp instrumentals for remixes, and refined data for multimodal AI pipelines.

## Use Cases

- **Creative Audio Projects:**  
  Craft karaoke tracks, remix songs, or generate unique mashups by isolating vocals from the music.

- **Podcast & Media Production:**  
  Enhance speech clarity by removing background music and noise, making your podcasts and interviews sound more professional.

- **Forensic Audio Analysis:**  
  Extract and analyze specific audio components to aid in investigations, enhance evidence clarity, or verify recording authenticity.

- **Multimodal AI & Data Cleaning:**  
  Prepare high-quality audio datasets for training multimodal large language models (LLMs) and other AI systems. Clean, separated audio improves speech recognition, sentiment analysis, and transcription accuracy.

- **Research & Development:**  
  Study individual audio elements in isolation to conduct advanced signal processing, acoustic analysis, or machine learning experiments.

## Features

- **Automated Audio Conversion:**  
  Seamlessly converts your input files (e.g., MP3) to WAV format, ensuring optimal compatibility for processing.

- **High-Quality Separation:**  
  Utilizes the cutting-edge Demucs model to accurately split audio into distinct vocal and instrumental components.

- **Flexible Deployment:**  
  Use the tool on your local machine or in cloud environments such as Google Colab and Jupyter Notebooks for an interactive experience.

- **Efficient Post-Processing:**  
  Automatically reconverts processed files back to MP3 format and cleans up temporary files for a streamlined workflow.

- **Integration Ready:**  
  Easily incorporate the separated audio into larger data pipelines, making it ideal for multimodal AI systems, creative projects, and more.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

### Install Dependencies

Install all necessary libraries with the following command:

```bash
pip install -q demucs pydub torch
```

If you're using Google Colab, run the command in a notebook cell to quickly set up your environment.

## Usage

### Python Script

The `voice_separation.py` script provides a command-line solution for audio separation. It’s designed to work both locally and in cloud-based environments.

#### Running Locally

```bash
python voice_separation.py path/to/your_audio_file.mp3
```

The script will:
- Convert your audio file to WAV if needed.
- Use Demucs to separate vocals and instrumentals.
- Convert the separated tracks back to MP3.
- Offer options to play and download the cleaned audio.

### Jupyter Notebook

For an interactive experience, the `voice_separation.ipynb` notebook allows you to:
- Upload your MP3 file directly within the notebook.
- Execute cells sequentially to process and visualize the audio separation.
- Listen to and download the resulting audio segments immediately.

## Code Overview

The project is structured into distinct modules that make integration straightforward:

- **Conversion Module:**  
  Converts various audio formats into WAV to standardize input for processing.

- **Separation Module:**  
  Leverages the Demucs model to effectively isolate vocals and instrumentals.

- **Post-Processing Module:**  
  Handles the conversion of processed WAV files back into popular formats like MP3, along with file cleanup.

- **Integration Module:**  
  Optimizes the output for integration into multimodal data pipelines, ensuring that both creative and technical projects benefit from high-quality audio data.
